### Heyo, World! ðŸ‘‹ ðŸŒŽ

I'm an artist and budding programmer based in New York City, currently enrolled at the Flatiron School for software engineering. 

ðŸŽ¨ Coding, just like my pencil or paintbrush, has been yet another medium for my creative expression. Interestingly enough, I've found my approach to visualizing and constructing imagery, interfaces, and worlds seems to manifest itself in the same way as my art! I see myself in the gaming industry, creating virtual reality experiences, or working on social media platforms. Through my work, I want to immerse users in new realms and spark their imagination. I believe that both art and technology have the power to inspire, provoke, and connect, and profoundly so when done in combination. My mission is to remain intentional and impactful with every stroke of the keyboard or brush. 

ðŸ§© I've dabbled a bit in HTML and game modding from the time I was 12. I always thought you had to be strictly left-brained to succeed in programming, but since I began my courses, I've been demonstrating proficiency in languages such as JavaScript, React, Python, and HTML/CSS through my courses.

ðŸ”­ Beyond these fundamentals, I've been gaining familiarity with Unity, Unreal Enginge, Adobe Suite, Figma, and took a leap into animation and 3D modeling. Exploring these exciting tools and frameworks has empowered me to weave together code and artistry in novel ways, and I can't wait to see where being in this space with my fellow techies will take me. It's one of the most welcoming communities I've been lucky to be a part of.

Take a glimpse at what I've been up to, and feel free to connect! ðŸ”Œ
